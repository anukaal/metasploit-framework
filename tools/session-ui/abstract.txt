Creation of a Meterpreter session Graphical User Interaction (UI) including visual listing of commands available
and post modules that can be used with the session. By displaying all the functionalities on an HTML web page, 
Metasploit can simplify the session interface for the users. As soon as user drops a Meterpreter shell, by
entering a single console command, the user can switch from meterpreter shell to a meterpreter web-shell.

command or post module and execute it within the web UI. This may also include streaming quality of audio as well 
as video and other fun behaviour.
